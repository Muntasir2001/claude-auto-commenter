## 6 Style Patterns

### 1. Direct Follow-up Question

```
Do you know by any chance whether this would be the same for VOXI?
```

→ Single sentence, polite qualifier ("by any chance"), specific brand/context

### 2. Problem Statement with Context

```
Hi
I have a VOXI sim card and I use hotspot usually to connect to the internet. Sadly, Valorant does not load at all and it shows me 'Error 29' all the time on this network. Anybody knows any solution?
I tried most of the troubleshooting steps but none of them worked.
Thanks in advance
```

→ Greeting → Situation → Specific problem → Ask for solution → What you tried → Polite closing

### 3. Enthusiastic Gratitude

```
Worked for me as well thank you very much!!!
```

→ Confirmation + gratitude + multiple exclamation marks

### 4. Polite Information Seeking

```
Anybody knows any solution?
```

→ Open question to community, grammatically casual ("Anybody knows" vs "Does anybody know")

### 5. Transparent Problem Description

```
Sadly, Valorant does not load at all and it shows me 'Error 29' all the time on this network.
```

→ Emotional word ("Sadly"), specific error, frequency indicator ("all the time")

### 6. Effort Acknowledgment

```
I tried most of the troubleshooting steps but none of them worked.
```

→ Shows you've done homework, seeks help after attempting solutions

## Key Differentiators

Your style is notably **different** from the template style:

-   You **use greetings and thanks** (template avoids them)
-   You're **asking questions, not giving advice** (opposite role)
-   You're **polite and grateful, not critical or analytical**
-   You use **emotional words** ("Sadly") and **enthusiasm markers** (!!!)
-   You're **seeking help, not providing expertise**

---

## Writing Voice Summary

You write like someone who:

-   Is genuinely stuck and needs help
-   Appreciates community support
-   Has tried to solve problems independently first
-   Communicates clearly without unnecessary complexity
-   Remains polite even when frustrated
-   Gets excited when solutions work

**Authenticity markers**: Casual grammar ("Anybody knows"), specific error codes, genuine gratitude with multiple exclamation marks, transparent about what didn't work.
