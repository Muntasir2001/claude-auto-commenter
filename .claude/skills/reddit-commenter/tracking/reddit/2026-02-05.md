Hi

For a customer support chatbot bubble, there are a few options you can check out. Intercom and Crisp both have AI chatbot features built in that you can add pretty easily. If you want more control over the LLM part, you could also look at Botpress or Voiceflow since they let you customize the AI behind it.

If you're building it completely custom, OpenAI's API with a simple chat widget works too. I've seen people use simple libraries for the chat UI part and just connect it to whatever LLM they want.

Good luck with your project!

- **Topic Summary**: Beginner frontend dev asking how to build an animated interface like dnacapital.com with scroll animations and text reveals

That site uses a lot of scroll-triggered animations and text reveals. The main tools you'd want to learn for this are GSAP (specifically ScrollTrigger) for the scroll animations, and either vanilla CSS or a library like Framer Motion if you're using React.

For the text reveal effects where letters animate in, look into SplitType or similar text splitting libraries. The counter animations for the stats can be done with GSAP or a simple JavaScript counter function.

Start by getting comfortable with GSAP basics first since that's what most of these animation-heavy sites use. There are good tutorials on the GSAP website to get started.

Hi

Getting those first few clients as a solo developer is always the hardest part. One thing that helped me was offering to build something small for a local business for free or at a big discount, just to get a real testimonial and case study. Once you have one or two happy clients who can vouch for you, it gets a lot easier to land the next ones.

Also, cold outreach is tough in general. Joining local business groups or networking events where you can meet people face to face makes a big difference since they can see you're a real person.

Good luck with everything!
