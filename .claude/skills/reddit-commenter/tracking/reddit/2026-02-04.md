Hi

I totally relate to this. I'm the same way - I need to actually do things to understand them. Reading documentation or watching videos never really sticks for me either.

For interviews, have you tried asking if they do take-home assignments instead? Some companies are more open to that format. It's way easier to show what you can do rather than explain it on the spot.

Good luck with the job search!
